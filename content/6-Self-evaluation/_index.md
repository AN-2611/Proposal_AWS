During my internship at the **First Cloud Journey (FCJ) program** from **September 08, 2025** to **December 08, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply my academic knowledge in a real-world work environment.

I participated in **a 12-week intensive Cloud/DevOps training program**, through which I improved my skills in **AWS infrastructure management (EC2, VPC, S3, ALB), Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and building CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline)**.

In terms of conduct, I always strived to complete tasks well, adhered to regulations, and actively communicated with colleagues to enhance work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship, I would like to self-assess based on the criteria below:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Excellent | Good | Average |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Technical Knowledge & Skills** | Industry knowledge, applying skills (IaC, K8s, CI/CD), quality of work | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Learning Ability** | Absorbing new knowledge quickly (a new tech weekly like Terraform, K8s, Docker) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Self-research ("Learned about..."), preparing for the next tasks | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of Responsibility** | Completing tasks on time, ensuring quality (completed 12/12 weeks) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to work hours, rules, and procedures | ☐ | ☐ | ✅ |
| 6 | **Willingness to Improve** | Readily accepting feedback and improving (shown in "Challenges & Solutions") | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting ideas, reporting on work (writing daily worklogs) | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Working effectively with mentor, participating in discussions | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional Conduct** | Respect for colleagues, work environment, serious completion of 12 weeks | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-Solving Mindset** | Identifying issues (debugged IAM, K8s, SG errors), proposing solutions | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to Project/Org** | Completed 100% of the training program, contributed documentation (W5, W11, W12) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | Overall assessment of the entire internship (mastered a large Cloud/DevOps stack) | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
