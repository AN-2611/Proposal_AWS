<span class="meta-info">by Rod Wallace | on 04 AUG 2025 in</span> [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/security-identity-compliance/aws-security-hub/), [Customer Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/post-types/customer-solutions/), [Open Source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/open-source/), [Security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/security-identity-compliance/security/), [Security, Identity, & Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/security-identity-compliance/), [Thought LeadershiLeadershi](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/category/post-types/thought-leadership/) | [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/) | [Comments]( Comments ) 

As organizations continue to innovate and scale their operations, security teams face a fundamental challenge: the lack of a common language for security data across diverse tools and services. This fragmentation makes it increasingly difficult to efficiently process and analyze vast amounts of security data, limiting threat detection and response capabilities. This is where the [Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)](https://schema.ocsf.io/) comes into play, providing a standardized approach that helps organizations streamline their security operations, improve threat detection, and accelerate incident response – all while unlocking the full potential of their security data.

By providing a standardized schema for security events, OCSF automatically normalizes data from various sources, creating a unified foundation for advanced analytics and AI-powered tools. This standardization is crucial for unleashing the full potential of generative AI in cybersecurity, allowing organizations to better identify patterns and correlations across multiple, disparate data sources.

With OCSF-compliant data, organizations can leverage generative AI to enhance their security operations in multiple ways. For example, generative AI can analyze OCSF-formatted security events to automatically map activities to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques, enhancing investigation capabilities with contextualized insights. These AI models can visualize and analyze complex attack sequences, making intricate threat patterns more intuitive and actionable for security teams, while also enabling predictive threat scenarios and proactive mitigation strategies.

The real impact of these AI-powered capabilities becomes clear through practical implementation. Leading organizations are already leveraging OCSF to transform their security operations, enabling more sophisticated threat detection and automated response capabilities. One compelling example is eightcap, whose journey demonstrates how combining OCSF with AI can revolutionize security operations.

## OCSF in Action: eightcap’s AI-Powered Security Operations
eightcap operates in a fast-moving fintech domain where foreign exchange, cryptocurrency, and derivatives platforms face relentless, evolving threats. In this environment, speed without structure creates noise. What eightcap needed was a new kind of signal architecture. That structure came through the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).

OCSF allowed eightcap to unify telemetry from AWS-native services, internal infrastructure, SaaS platforms, and trading systems. It eliminated brittle point-to-point integrations and provided a common language for reasoning across diverse sources. But for eightcap, OCSF wasn’t the destination. It was the foundation for something more radical: the Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC).

At the center of eightcap’s model are AI agents, modular reasoning systems (like autonomous co-pilots) embedded directly into core security workflows. These agents ingest structured data, form hypotheses, query systems, and assist (or act) in triaging and investigating events. They don’t rely on rigid playbooks. They adapt dynamically, responding to situations in real time based on what the data reveals. This is where OCSF becomes indispensable. Structured telemetry is the precondition for agentic reasoning. Without a shared schema, there is no shared understanding. With it, AI agents gain the clarity they need to reason effectively and take action.

As security teams drown in signals, the future belongs to those who can build workflows that think. eightcap’s Agentic SOC is designed around that future. In the years ahead, one of the most scarce and valuable resources in cybersecurity will not be compute or bandwidth, but context window: the ability to see enough, fast enough, to act intelligently. OCSF expands that window. It enables agents to connect signals across time, systems, and services. It allows for consistent reasoning about scope, intent, and impact, at speed. And it positions human analysts not as alert responders, but as strategic decision-makers supported by systems that understand their environment.

As security environments grow more complex, traditional SOCs respond by hiring. eightcap took a different path. By embedding intelligent agents into core workflows, the Agentic SOC reduces the need for manual analysis at scale. The result is a team that grows in capability, not size. OCSF doesn’t just improve data quality, it gives machines the language they need to think. eightcap is not alone in exploring these ideas, but it is among the first to operationalize them at scale, setting a precedent for what intelligent security operations can truly become. [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bTC-3ZJT3E&feature=youtu.be) how eightcap transformed their security operations with OCSF.

Dave Gruber, Principal Analyst at ESG, emphasizes the significance of this transformation: “The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) is becoming increasingly significant as we enter the era of the agentic Security Operations Center (SOC). As SOCs evolve towards more autonomous and intelligent operations, OCSF’s standardized data schema serves as a crucial foundation for enabling seamless interaction between security tools, automated workflows, and human analysts. Organizations exploring or considering agentic capabilities in their SOC will find OCSF’s normalized data structure valuable for breaking down data silos, accelerating threat detection, and enabling more intelligent, context-aware security operations across their security stack. The framework’s ability to provide a common language for both human analysts and automated systems could be transformative for the next generation of security operations.”
## Advancing OCSF: What’s New in v1.5 and v1.6
As the OCSF community grows, so does the framework itself. Recent updates in versions 1.5 and 1.6 have significantly enhanced OCSF’s capabilities:

- Expanded MITRE framework integration, now offering comprehensive support for ATT&CK®, D3FEND®, and ATLAS®.
- Introduction of a new graph-based object model, allowing for better representation of resource relationships and attack path graphing. This enhancement is particularly valuable for AI models analyzing complex attack paths and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- Enriched schemas for threat intelligence, campaigns, and actors, providing richer context for security analysis. This depth of information enables AI systems to draw more accurate conclusions and predict potential threats.
- Addition of new event classes, including IAM Analysis Finding, Application Security Posture Finding, and Live Evidence Info, broadening OCSF’s applicability and the range of data available for AI models.
- Standardized modeling support for anomalies and baselines in Detection Findings, crucial for training AI models to accurately identify deviations from normal behavior.

These enhancements significantly improve OCSF’s ability to support advanced AI-driven security analytics and operations.

## The Growing OCSF Ecosystem
The OCSF community has grown significantly since its inception, now with over 1,100 contributors and 200+ organizations. This collaborative approach ensures that OCSF continues to evolve to meet the dynamic needs of the cybersecurity landscape. The community’s diverse expertise allows for rapid iteration and improvement of the framework, addressing emerging threats and new use cases as they arise.

In addition, the rapid adoption of OCSF across the industry demonstrates its transformative potential. We’re witnessing a diverse range of sectors embracing OCSF, from healthcare giants like CVS Health to media and entertainment leaders such as IPG and MGM Resorts. In the technology sector, companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise are leveraging OCSF to enhance their security operations. The telecommunications industry is also recognizing the value of OCSF, with companies like Comcast adopting the framework to enhance their threat detection capabilities.
