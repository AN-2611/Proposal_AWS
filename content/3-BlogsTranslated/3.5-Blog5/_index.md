# How an infrastructure developer leverages AI certification to drive innovation
<span class="meta-info">by Tim Trsar | on 04 AUG 2025  | in</span> [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/aws-training-and-certification/), [Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/post-types/best-practices/), [Generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/category/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/) | [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/integrate-ai-powered-coding-assistance-in-secure-environments-using-continue-and-amazon-bedrock/) 

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we’re committed to democratizing [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/), making it accessible to professionals across all roles. Alexandra Fernandez, an infrastructure developer at a leading financial company, exemplifies how [AWS Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) programs are empowering technology professionals to embrace AI transformation, even before it becomes a requirement in their current roles.

With 4 years of cloud technology experience, Alexandra recognized early that AI would fundamentally change how we work. “Whether you’re a writer, a social media manager, or a software engineer, AI will become an essential tool for increasing productivity,” she explains. This forward-thinking mindset aligns with how AWS has pioneered cloud computing so anyone can access powerful technology.

## Applying knowledge to real-world projects
As a member of the [AWS Community Builders](https://builder.aws.com/connect/community/community-builders) program, Alexandra didn’t wait for AI to become mandatory in her role. Instead, she proactively pursued the [AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/), applying her knowledge to real-world projects. She’s currently working on Kiu, a virtual agent powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), designed to accelerate [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/aws/) learning and strengthen community connections. This practical application demonstrates how AWS is democratizing generative AI through Amazon Bedrock, making it a seamless way to build and scale generative AI applications.

Alexandra’s journey with AWS began 3 years ago when she won third place in the [AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) competition at the [AWS Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/?ams%23interactive-card-vertical%23pattern-data-1911509906.filter=%257B%2522filters%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D) in Atlanta. This experience sparked her interest in [machine learning (ML)](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/) with AWS, leading to a methodical approach to certification: starting with [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/), progressing to [AWS Certified AI Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/), and most recently [AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate/), planning for more advanced ML certifications. This structured path reflects the AWS commitment to providing the most comprehensive set of data and AI services in the industry.

The impact of AWS Certification extends beyond individual achievement. As part of the AWS community, Alexandra actively contributes to both English- and Spanish-speaking AWS communities, sharing her knowledge and helping others prepare for an AI-driven future. This exemplifies the strength of the AWS community, which includes millions of customers and over 100,000 partners globally.

## Proactive and prepared
“It’s about being prepared before these changes become mandatory,” Alexandra notes. Her experience shows how professionals use AWS Certification programs to stay ahead of technological developments while building practical skills. She’s already implementing prompt engineering and [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]( Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)) techniques in her projects, demonstrating how AWS provides the tools and training needed to transform ideas into reality.

Alexandra’s story reflects a broader trend we’re seeing across industries: professionals taking initiative to build AI capabilities before they become essential job requirements. With AWS offering over 60% more services and 40% more features than the next closest cloud provider, we’re providing professionals like Fernandez the tools and training they need to drive innovation in their organizations.

For technology professionals looking to follow Alexandra’s path, AWS offers comprehensive certification programs that provide practical, hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI technologies. As Fernandez’s experience shows, the journey to AI expertise doesn’t require an AI-specific role—it requires curiosity, dedication, and [the right learning resources](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/generative-ai/).
