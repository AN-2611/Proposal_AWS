###  [Blog 1 - Intelligent coding at your fingertips: Introducing an agentic coding experience in your IDE](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces a new agentic coding experience in IDEs, where AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can now take actions—such as editing files, running commands, and building code—based on natural language input. It marks a shift from passive assistance to active collaboration in software development.

###  [Blog 2 - Insights and learnings from Amazon Q in Connect at NatWest](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog explores how NatWest Group implemented Amazon Q in Connect—an AI-powered assistant for contact center agents. It shares key insights from their pilot program, including challenges in user acceptance testing (UAT), integration with legacy knowledge systems, and measuring success. The goal was to improve agent efficiency, reduce average handle time (AHT), and enhance customer satisfaction through generative AI.

###  [Blog 3 - Integrate AI-powered coding assistance in secure environments using Continue and Amazon Bedrock](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog explains how organizations operating in highly regulated environments—such as government or public sector—can securely integrate AI-powered coding assistants into their development workflows. By combining the open-source tool Continue with Amazon Bedrock, developers can access generative AI capabilities directly in their IDE while maintaining strict compliance and data sovereignty. The post walks through an architecture that supports secure inference, customizable prompts, and private API endpoints, making it suitable for air-gapped or GovCloud deployments.

###  [Blog 4 - Improving network observability with new AWS Outposts racks network metrics](3.4-Blog4/)
This blog introduces two new Amazon CloudWatch metrics—VifConnectionStatus and VifBgpSessionState—designed to enhance network observability for AWS Outposts racks. These metrics help users monitor the health and performance of network connections between Outpost Networking Devices (ONDs) and Customer Network Devices (CNDs), including service link and local gateway traffic. The post explains how these metrics can reduce troubleshooting time and improve operational resilience in hybrid cloud deployments.

###  [Blog 5 - How an infrastructure developer leverages AI certification to drive innovation](3.5-Blog5/)
